theme: Build during the day, defend at night

# Pitch
Play as a vampire.
During the day feed your castle to upgrade yourself and taunt the villagers to attack you,
then at night open your gates and invite them to attack you, so you can slaughter them and take their blood.

# Building Round
Begin the day by feeding your castle.
if you don't have enough blood to feed your castle you lose.
Each undamaged room upgrades your stats, the stronger the room the stronger the upgrade.
Spend the rest of the day feeding the rooms to repair or upgrade them.

# Defense Round
At night open your gates and let the villagers in.

Attack villagers by standing near them.
